Variation of my ususal drumplot code to specifically use MSVF data from IRIS. Bash script controls running and configuration. Specific filtering is applied to show events located by NEIC near HTHH.

`query.csv` is downloaded after NEIC search, and is used with ObsPy dayplot event labeling to mark events with their magnitude.
